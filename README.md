# Contact Manager API

## Overview

The Contact Manager API is a Node.js and Express application that provides a secure and scalable solution for managing contact information.

Data validation is handled with Joi, and route protection ensures secure access to user-specific data.

- **CRUD Operations**: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for managing contacts.
- **Input Validation**: Data integrity is maintained through Joi validation for both user and contact information.
